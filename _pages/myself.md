# About Daily Me

My faith is central to my life — I find peace and purpose in believing in God and walking with Him each day.

**Faith & Spiritual Life**
- I enjoy reading the Bible and reflecting on Scripture
- I regularly listen to sermons and teachings to grow in my understanding

**Music**
I play the guitar and piano, and I love spending time practicing and exploring new pieces. Music is also both a passion and a way to worship.

**Excercise**
I sometimes play badminton, table tennis, and basketball, and I work out when I am free.

**Languages**
I am interested in learning languages, such as Japanese. Whether it's improving my English, exploring new tongues, or connecting with people across cultures, I find the process of language learning rewarding and enriching.
