I am a Ph.D. Student in Construction Management Technology at [Purdue University](https://polytechnic.purdue.edu/newsroom/purdue-polytechnic-phd-student-wins-ieee-best-paper-award-and-sea-grant-scholarship). My research interests include:

* Urban-scale 3D reconstruction for energy modeling
* NeRF 3D reconstruction for building inspection
* BIM-enabled VR environments for construction visualization
* Prevention through Advanced Immersive Technologies Design (PtATD)
